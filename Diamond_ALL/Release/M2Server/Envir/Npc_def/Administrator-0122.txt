when you request guild war, ID of same guild member will appear\
in blue collor. on the other side, ID of enemy guild member will\
appear orange.\
If you are connected during a Guild war, the message:\
'war with certain guild' will appear in chatting window and even\
if you kill a member of the enemy guild now fighting with, you.\
will not be regarded as PK. \

[@warrule]
Guild war cannot take place in village.\
It can be executed out of certain ranges from village\
or inside contest area (like inside some buildings)\
However, if you PK your ID will be red in colour\
even during war.\ \
<back/@guildwarexp>

[@propose]
Proposal of guild war can only be requested\
by Guildchief. \ \
