Hello <$USERNAME>\
Evil creatures have infested the land where i live.\
Its about time they were sorted out.\
You look like someone who could do it.\
There could be a fine reward if you succeed\ \

[@next]
Powerful beasts roam the lands at night\
They raid villages and slaughter all who face them\
Leaked documents from the Bichon Administrator suggest\
that there is a evil king controlling them all who\
if not dealt with soon could take over the whole land.\ \
<What will i get out of it/@next2>\
<No way, thats suicide/@exit>

[@next2]
The monsters take masses of gold and riches from\
the villages they raid.\
Anything you find is yours to keep\
So are you up for it or are you a chicken?\ \
<Im ready. Take me there/@letsgo>\
<I value my life more than gold/@exit>
