You seem to be interested in an old tale. Ok.\
What do you want to know?\
<I'd like to hear about the HolySword/@quest>\

[@next_quest]
#IF
#SAY
No information about him remains. I just heard that the former\
Rev.taoist of this school thought he was pitiful and permitted\
him to stay here. Because he was running away as he had committed\
a serious crime before. But he betrayed that trust and stole the\
sword, the best sword of this school, and dissapeared.\ \
<Can you tell me What HolySword is?/@next_quest1>\

[@next_quest1]
#IF
#SAY
The chronicle or specification for the HolySword vanished since\
the sword disappeared from here long time ago. So I don't know\
it's detail either. People say it cayses storms to blow dragons to\
appear. But thats just hot air. And also an expression of pride and\
love for the disappeared best sword of this school.\ \
<Can you tell me where the HolySword is?/@next_quest2>\

[@next_quest2]
#IF
#SAY
According to the former Rev.taoist of this school, the person who\
stole the HolySword went forward in to the Redmoon Valley across a\
Tree path. Then a big group of heroes went there to pursue him but\
no one came back. By perfroming magical astrology I found out there\
was a very strong demon in Redmoon valley and that it seemed to be\
related to the tragedy.\ \
<I see and appreciate your answer/@next_quest3>\

[@next_quest3]
#IF
#SAY
A long time ago, the Redmoon valley was athe habitat of the Jade Crystal\
Before the demonic power came there. If a certain special power got into\
the JadeStick then taoistic defenses will come out of it,  It requires a\
JadeCrystal holding. Some special taoistic power to pass there, Only a\
taoist od the highest order is able to make a key JadeCrystal. It is \
Possible that the heroes who went into the Redmoon Valley left a sign with\
a JadeCrystal there. Keep this in mind.\ \

You are so curious to wonder what \

Ok i'll tell you what i can remember. \ \
<next/@next>


[@next]
it must be approximately 90 years ago now.  \
when i was only a young fellow in my early twenties. \
but my martial art skill was so good as to place me within\
the top ten people with taoist skills. \
It is true \ \
<next/@next1>

[@next1]
It was rumored around Bichon province \
all that time that a villain stole \
the secret know-how and \
treasures of each prominent taoist school, \
his name was Abel\
<next/@next2>

[@next2]
As the damage grew, \
many heroes struggled to arrest Abel and together \
stove to catch him in a trap. But\
we all made a mistake and underestimated him\
we never dreamed that he would have\
mastered the best martial art skill of all.\ \
<next/@next3>

[@next3]
We organized a new group consisting of high level heroes after \
the first group consisted of middle level heroes failed to arrest him \
Finaly we found him in Woomyon Woods. \
Listen carefully. \ \
<next/@next4>

[@next4]
Fourteen heroes surrounded him but he was never scared \
What a great man he was! \
We tried persuading him to surrender to us\
but he didn't answer, consequently a fight began\ \
<next/@next5>

[@next5]
We could not break him because not only. \
was his martial art skill really the best \
but also the heroes wer enot in harmony to attack him \
so, i made a decision to fight man to man. \
The heroes stepped back \
A man on man fight between me and him began.\ \
<next/@next6>

[@next6]
At the end of a fierce fight i was heavily wounded. \
but i had injured his leg. \
I saw he could not even stand so i relaxed my attention\
Then Abel floated in the air as with a kind of \
high level martial art and dissapeared \
We traced his blood but we failed to find him again\ \
<next/@next7>

[@next7]
Abel disappeared and the secret know-how was gone with him. \
It was rumored that a certain party \
who wanted the secret know-how.\
exclusively for themselves hid Abel away \
It caused lot of groups to fight against each other. \
Although this fight lasted for ten years no one ever found out \
a single clue to his whereabouts\
Finally this fight was over without any satisfactory conclusion\ \
<next/@next8>

[@next8]
So far there is no one who has seen Abel since this incident\
though it would be a permanent riddle. But there is a rumor \
It says a big cave was found out in the Tree path these days, \
and the secret know-how. \
Abel stole long time ago is hidden there. \ \
<next/@next9>

[@next9]
But there are many strong monsters there, \
so they will kill you when you are there \
Now i am too old. For am i not a Rev.taoist \

I'll go there and check it out..\ \

Holy Sword... It was our very best sword a long time ago. But we don't\
